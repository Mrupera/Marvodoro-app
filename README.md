## 💡 Reflection: Using V0
This project was made to **honestly explore how V0 helps developers**:
- ✅ **Speed**: V0 created the timer logic + UI scaffolding in minutes.  
- ✅ **Learning**: Easy to understand and customize the generated code.  
- ⚠️ **Limitations**: Code sometimes needed manual fixing (e.g., timer state handling).  
- 💡 **Takeaway**: V0 is a powerful assistant but not a replacement — combining its output with human creativity (Marvel theme + special relax mode) makes the project complete.
